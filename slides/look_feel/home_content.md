# Home page content

The geonode-project provides some predefined templates to change the home page and the general site content.

In the `my_geonode/my_geonode/templates` folder we can edit the site_index.html.

Try to edit the content of the `jumbotron`box in the page, save and refresh your browser to see the changes.
