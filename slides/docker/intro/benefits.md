**What's the benefit?**

- Portability (*at first glance*). However challenges can raise for complex application like GeoNode (How to support all platforms?)
- Faster development process **==>** No need to install 3rd parties, run their containers (*PostgreSQL*, *Rabbitmq*, *Elasticsearch*, *etc*)
- Handy deliver **==>** Ship containers rather than applications
